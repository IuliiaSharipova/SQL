-- self join 
/*A self-join joins data from the same table. In other words, it joins a table with itself. 
Records taken from the table are matched to other records from the same table. 
Why would you do this? You may need to compare a value with another value from the same row. 
You canâ€™t do that unless you join the table to itself and compare the values as if 
they were in two separate records.
